= Zulu Metadata API Java Client

Currently, this contains two hacked-together, scripts that dump the information needed for updating https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/compilers/zulu/24.nix

== ZuluQuery Java

Currently requires `jbang` to run and can be run with:

[source]
----
./ZuluQuery.java
----

Which will print a usage string.

== list-all-nixpkgs-images.sh

A BASH script that calls ./ZuluQuery.java eight times to get the information
needed to update the `24.nix` file.
